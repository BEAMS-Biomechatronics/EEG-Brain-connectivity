## Overview

### `conn.m`
Main script that computes connectivity features from patients EEG following the classical steps: pre-processing, nodes and edges computations, and features extraction.

You need to specify:

(1) all parameters concerning your connectivity analyses:
- *f_bands*: list of frequency bands of interest
- *des_fs*: desired sampling frequency
- *channels*: list of EEG channels of interest
- *des_ref*: desired reference
- *reref*: list of re-referencing schemes of interest
- *rej_t*: artifact rejection threshold (µV)
- *window*: window  size (in seconds)
- *overlap*: overlap between windows (in seconds)
- *measrs*: list of association measures of interest
- *featrs*: number of connectivity features to extract

(2) the specifics regarding your database:
- *files*: path to your patients files
- *save*: path to the folder in which you want to save your analyses
- *patients*: number of patients in your cohort
- *start*: analysis start time (in seconds)
- *duration*: length of analysis (in seconds)
- *diff_pat*: list of the patients you wish to re-reference to the *desired ref* and/or to resample to the *desired fs* specified above

The data of each patient should be stored in a MAT structure with 2 fields:
- *channels*: structure of size 1 x *number of channels* with 2 fields: Name and Fs
- *data*: double of size *length of recordings* [samples] x *number of channels* containing the EEG voltages (µV)

### `data.m`
Class handling all processing on the raw data, including data preparation, pre-processing, and window splitting.

### `measures.m`
Class handling all association measures implementations (definition and parametrization) and the computations of the associations between nodes to generate the adjacency matrix.

### `network.m`
Class handling the extraction of network features from the adjacency matrix.
